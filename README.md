## Introduction:
This is a Power BI project on Hospitality analysis of an imaginary Hotel called **Rathnam Group of Hotels**. 
This project is to analyze and derive insights to answer critical questions and help the store make Data-Driven Decisions. 

## Problem Statement:
1. What is the Occupancy Percentage of the Hotels ?
2. What is the worth in Dollars of the revenue generated ?
3. What are the busy days and free days of the Hotel occupancy?

## Skills/Concepts Learnt & Demonstrated:
The following Power BI features were learnt and incorporated:
- DAX,
- Columns,
- Measures,
- Page Navigation,
- Modelling,
- Filters,
- Tooltip,
- Button

## Modelling:
Automatically derived relationships are adjusted to remove and replace unwanted relationships.

## Conclusions & Recommendations:
- With the revenue of around $1.7bn the overall revenue generated is enormous. ðŸ¤“
- But there are few loose ends like the occupancy percentange which can be dealt to encourage the better Customer Cervice Results.
Recommendation: For a better and depp dive into the analytics, the datasets of the previous years will be required for comparison and data driven decision making.

### Disclaimer
This is my First trial project which has been demonstrated and taught by **CodeBasics YouTube Channel**.
